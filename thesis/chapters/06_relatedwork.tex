The Brewer's \cite{brewerRobustDistributedSystems2000} CAP theorem and Abadi's \cite{abadiConsistencyTradeoffsModern2012} PACELC extension remains as the basis for design and evaluation of all horizontally scalable systems.
We demonstrated two DDBMS, making different trade offs when it comes to choosing latency (CrateDB) over consistency (MobilityDBC).
