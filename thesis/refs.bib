  abstract = {Due to the surge of spatio-temporal data volume, the popularity of
              location-based services and applications, and the importance of
              extracted knowledge from spatio-temporal data to solve a wide range
              of real-world problems, a plethora of research and development work
              has been done in the area of spatial and spatio-temporal data
              analytics in the past decade. The main goal of existing works was
              to develop algorithms and technologies to capture, store, manage,
              analyze, and visualize spatial or spatio-temporal data. The
              researchers have contributed either by adding spatio-temporal
              support with existing systems, by developing a new system from
              scratch, or by implementing algorithms for processing
              spatio-temporal data. The existing ecosystem of spatial and
              spatio-temporal data analytics systems can be categorized into
              three groups, (1) spatial databases (SQL and NoSQL), (2) big
              spatial data processing infrastructures, and (3) programming
              languages and GIS software. Since existing surveys mostly
              investigated infrastructures for processing big spatial data, this
              survey has explored the whole ecosystem of spatial and
              spatio-temporal analytics. This survey also portrays the importance
              and future of spatial and spatio-temporal data analytics.},

              sciences, neuroscience, epidemiology, transportation, mobile health
              , and Earth sciences. Spatio-temporal data differ from relational
              data for which computational approaches are developed in the
              data-mining community for multiple decades in that both spatial and
              temporal attributes are available in addition to the actual
              measurements/attributes. The presence of these attributes
              introduces additional challenges that needs to be dealt with.
              Approaches for mining spatio-temporal data have been studied for
              over a decade in the data-mining community. In this article, we
              present a broad survey of this relatively young field of
              spatio-temporal data mining. We discuss different types of
              spatio-temporal data and the relevant data-mining questions that
              arise in the context of analyzing each of these datasets. Based on
              the nature of the data-mining problem studied, we classify
              literature on spatio-temporal data mining into six major
              categories: clustering, predictive learning, change detection,
              frequent pattern mining, anomaly detection, and relationship
              mining. We discuss the various forms of spatio-temporal data-mining
              problems in each of these categories.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the collection of moving object data is significantly
              increasing due to the ubiquity of GPS-enabled devices. Managing and
              analyzing this kind of data is crucial in many application domains,
              including social mobility, pandemics, and transportation. In
              previous work, we have proposed the MobilityDB moving object
              database system. It is a production-ready system, that is built on
              top of PostgreSQL and PostGIS. It accepts SQL queries and offers
              most of the common spatiotemporal types and operations. In this
              paper, to address the scalability requirement of big data, we
              provide an architecture and an implementation of a distributed
              moving object database system based on MobilityDB. More
              specifically, we define: (1) an architecture for deploying a
              distributed MobilityDB database on a cluster using readily
              available tools, (2) two alternative trajectory data partitioning
              and index partitioning methods, and (3) a query optimizer that is
              capable of distributing spatiotemporal SQL queries over multiple
              MobilityDB instances. The overall outcome is that the cluster is
              managed in SQL at the run-time and that the user queries are
              transparently distributed and executed. This is validated with
              experiments using a real dataset, which also compares MobilityDB
              with other relevant systems.},

              hierarchical statistical modeling concepts and the latest

              also winners of the 2011 PROSE Award in the Mathematics category,
              for the book ``Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data'' (2011),
              published by John Wiley and Sons. (The PROSE awards, for
              Professional and Scholarly Excellence, are given by the Association
              of American Publishers, the national trade association of the US
              book publishing industry.) Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data has
              now been reprinted with small corrections to the text and the
              bibliography. The overall content and pagination of the new
              printing remains the same; the difference comes in the form of
              corrections to typographical errors, editing of incomplete and
              missing references, and some updated spatio-temporal
              interpretations. From understanding environmental processes and
              climate trends to developing new technologies for mapping
              public-health data and the spread of invasive-species, there is a
              high demand for statistical analyses of data that take spatial,
              temporal, and spatio-temporal information into account. Statistics
              for Spatio-Temporal Data presents a systematic approach to key
              quantitative techniques that incorporate the latest advances in
              statistical computing as well as hierarchical, particularly
              Bayesian, statistical modeling, with an emphasis on dynamical
              spatio-temporal models. Cressie and Wikle supply a unique
              presentation that incorporates ideas from the areas of time series
              and spatial statistics as well as stochastic processes. Beginning
              with separate treatments of temporal data and spatial data, the
              book combines these concepts to discuss spatio-temporal statistical
              methods for understanding complex processes. Topics of coverage
              include: Exploratory methods for spatio-temporal data, including
              visualization, spectral analysis, empirical orthogonal function
              analysis, and LISAs Spatio-temporal covariance functions,
              spatio-temporal kriging, and time series of spatial processes
              Development of hierarchical dynamical spatio-temporal models
              (DSTMs), with discussion of linear and nonlinear DSTMs and
              computational algorithms for their implementation Quantifying and
              exploring spatio-temporal variability in scientific applications,
              including case studies based on real-world environmental data
              Throughout the book, interesting applications demonstrate the
              relevance of the presented concepts. Vivid, full-color graphics
              emphasize the visual nature of the topic, and a related FTP site
              contains supplementary material. Statistics for Spatio-Temporal
              Data is an excellent book for a graduate-level course on
              spatio-temporal statistics. It is also a valuable reference for
              researchers and practitioners in the fields of applied mathematics,
              engineering, and the environmental and health sciences.},

              space and time. It is both a thoughtful book and a book that covers
              a large amount of material. The book would be a good reference for
              a researcher in the field.Before reading this book, I naively
              expected that the bulk of it would contain a chapter on time series
              analysis, a chapter on spatial statistics, and finally a chapter
              combining these two topics into spatio-temporal statistical models.
              The book does contain these chapters, and in addition a chapter
              about exploratory methods for spatio-temporal data. The chapter on
              spatio-temporal statistical models has subchapters on
              spatio-temporal covariance functions, spatio-temporal kriging,
              time-series of spatial processes, spatio-temporal point processes,
              and spatio-temporal components-of-variation models---more or less
              as I expected. However, this chapter does not form the main focus
              of the book, which instead is ``hierarchical dynamic
              spatio-temporal models'' (hierarchical DSTMs) presented in the
              subsequent three chapters. Actually, the field of spatio-temporal
              statistical modeling has developed much from the space-time
              separable models that were considered 15 years ago, and now also
              incorporates literature from other fields like the atmospheric
              sciences. I have been delighted to learn about all this.},

  abstract = {Despite two decades of research in moving object databases and a
              few research prototypes that have been proposed, there is not yet a
              mainstream system targeted for industrial use. In this article, we
              present MobilityDB, a moving object database that extends the type
              system of PostgreSQL and PostGIS with abstract data types for
              representing moving object data. The types are fully integrated
              into the platform to reuse its powerful data management features.
              Furthermore, MobilityDB builds on existing operations, indexing,
              aggregation, and optimization framework. This is all made
              accessible via the SQL query interface.},
