  abstract = {Due to the surge of spatio-temporal data volume, the popularity of location-based services and applications, and the importance of extracted knowledge from spatio-temporal data to solve a wide range of real-world problems, a plethora of research and development work has been done in the area of spatial and spatio-temporal data analytics in the past decade. The main goal of existing works was to develop algorithms and technologies to capture, store, manage, analyze, and visualize spatial or spatio-temporal data. The researchers have contributed either by adding spatio-temporal support with existing systems, by developing a new system from scratch, or by implementing algorithms for processing spatio-temporal data. The existing ecosystem of spatial and spatio-temporal data analytics systems can be categorized into three groups, (1) spatial databases (SQL and NoSQL), (2) big spatial data processing infrastructures, and (3) programming languages and GIS software. Since existing surveys mostly investigated infrastructures for processing big spatial data, this survey has explored the whole ecosystem of spatial and spatio-temporal analytics. This survey also portrays the importance and future of spatial and spatio-temporal data analytics.},

  abstract = {Large volumes of spatio-temporal data are increasingly collected and studied in diverse domains, including climate science, social sciences, neuroscience, epidemiology, transportation, mobile health, and Earth sciences. Spatio-temporal data differ from relational data for which computational approaches are developed in the data-mining community for multiple decades in that both spatial and temporal attributes are available in addition to the actual measurements/attributes. The presence of these attributes introduces additional challenges that needs to be dealt with. Approaches for mining spatio-temporal data have been studied for over a decade in the data-mining community. In this article, we present a broad survey of this relatively young field of spatio-temporal data mining. We discuss different types of spatio-temporal data and the relevant data-mining questions that arise in the context of analyzing each of these datasets. Based on the nature of the data-mining problem studied, we classify literature on spatio-temporal data mining into six major categories: clustering, predictive learning, change detection, frequent pattern mining, anomaly detection, and relationship mining. We discuss the various forms of spatio-temporal data-mining problems in each of these categories.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the collection of moving object data is significantly increasing due to the ubiquity of GPS-enabled devices. Managing and analyzing this kind of data is crucial in many application domains, including social mobility, pandemics, and transportation. In previous work, we have proposed the MobilityDB moving object database system. It is a production-ready system, that is built on top of PostgreSQL and PostGIS. It accepts SQL queries and offers most of the common spatiotemporal types and operations. In this paper, to address the scalability requirement of big data, we provide an architecture and an implementation of a distributed moving object database system based on MobilityDB. More specifically, we define: (1) an architecture for deploying a distributed MobilityDB database on a cluster using readily available tools, (2) two alternative trajectory data partitioning and index partitioning methods, and (3) a query optimizer that is capable of distributing spatiotemporal SQL queries over multiple MobilityDB instances. The overall outcome is that the cluster is managed in SQL at the run-time and that the user queries are transparently distributed and executed. This is validated with experiments using a real dataset, which also compares MobilityDB with other relevant systems.},

  abstract = {Winner of the 2013 DeGroot Prize.  A state-of-the-art presentation of spatio-temporal processes, bridging classic ideas with modern hierarchical statistical modeling concepts and the latest computational methods Noel Cressie and Christopher K. Wikle, are also winners of the 2011 PROSE Award in the Mathematics category, for the book ``Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data'' (2011), published by John Wiley and Sons. (The PROSE awards, for Professional and Scholarly Excellence, are given by the Association of American Publishers, the national trade association of the US book publishing industry.) Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data has now been reprinted with small corrections to the text and the bibliography. The overall content and pagination of the new printing remains the same; the difference comes in the form of corrections to typographical errors, editing of incomplete and missing references, and some updated spatio-temporal interpretations. From understanding environmental processes and climate trends to developing new technologies for mapping public-health data and the spread of invasive-species, there is a high demand for statistical analyses of data that take spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal information into account. Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data presents a systematic approach to key quantitative techniques that incorporate the latest advances in statistical computing as well as hierarchical, particularly Bayesian, statistical modeling, with an emphasis on dynamical spatio-temporal models. Cressie and Wikle supply a unique presentation that incorporates ideas from the areas of time series and spatial statistics as well as stochastic processes. Beginning with separate treatments of temporal data and spatial data, the book combines these concepts to discuss spatio-temporal statistical methods for understanding complex processes. Topics of coverage include:  Exploratory methods for spatio-temporal data, including visualization, spectral analysis, empirical orthogonal function analysis, and LISAs Spatio-temporal covariance functions, spatio-temporal kriging, and time series of spatial processes Development of hierarchical dynamical spatio-temporal models (DSTMs), with discussion of linear and nonlinear DSTMs and computational algorithms for their implementation Quantifying and exploring spatio-temporal variability in scientific applications, including case studies based on real-world environmental data  Throughout the book, interesting applications demonstrate the relevance of the presented concepts. Vivid, full-color graphics emphasize the visual nature of the topic, and a related FTP site contains supplementary material. Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data is an excellent book for a graduate-level course on spatio-temporal statistics. It is also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the fields of applied mathematics, engineering, and the environmental and health sciences.},
