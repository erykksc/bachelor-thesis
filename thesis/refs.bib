  abstract = {Due to the surge of spatio-temporal data volume, the popularity of location-based services and applications, and the importance of extracted knowledge from spatio-temporal data to solve a wide range of real-world problems, a plethora of research and development work has been done in the area of spatial and spatio-temporal data analytics in the past decade. The main goal of existing works was to develop algorithms and technologies to capture, store, manage, analyze, and visualize spatial or spatio-temporal data. The researchers have contributed either by adding spatio-temporal support with existing systems, by developing a new system from scratch, or by implementing algorithms for processing spatio-temporal data. The existing ecosystem of spatial and spatio-temporal data analytics systems can be categorized into three groups, (1) spatial databases (SQL and NoSQL), (2) big spatial data processing infrastructures, and (3) programming languages and GIS software. Since existing surveys mostly investigated infrastructures for processing big spatial data, this survey has explored the whole ecosystem of spatial and spatio-temporal analytics. This survey also portrays the importance and future of spatial and spatio-temporal data analytics.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the collection of moving object data is significantly increasing due to the ubiquity of GPS-enabled devices. Managing and analyzing this kind of data is crucial in many application domains, including social mobility, pandemics, and transportation. In previous work, we have proposed the MobilityDB moving object database system. It is a production-ready system, that is built on top of PostgreSQL and PostGIS. It accepts SQL queries and offers most of the common spatiotemporal types and operations. In this paper, to address the scalability requirement of big data, we provide an architecture and an implementation of a distributed moving object database system based on MobilityDB. More specifically, we define: (1) an architecture for deploying a distributed MobilityDB database on a cluster using readily available tools, (2) two alternative trajectory data partitioning and index partitioning methods, and (3) a query optimizer that is capable of distributing spatiotemporal SQL queries over multiple MobilityDB instances. The overall outcome is that the cluster is managed in SQL at the run-time and that the user queries are transparently distributed and executed. This is validated with experiments using a real dataset, which also compares MobilityDB with other relevant systems.},

  abstract = {Despite two decades of research in moving object databases and a few research prototypes that have been proposed, there is not yet a mainstream system targeted for industrial use. In this article, we present MobilityDB, a moving object database that extends the type system of PostgreSQL and PostGIS with abstract data types for representing moving object data. The types are fully integrated into the platform to reuse its powerful data management features. Furthermore, MobilityDB builds on existing operations, indexing, aggregation, and optimization framework. This is all made accessible via the SQL query interface.},
