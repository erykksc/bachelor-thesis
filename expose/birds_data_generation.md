# Bird Movement Data Generation Aspects

## Migration Aspects
* Seasonal migrations (timing, global flyways, spring vs fall routes, weather influence)
* Species variation (flight speed/altitude ranges, migration distances, flock behavior)
* Daily movements (dawn/dusk peaks, feeding patterns, roosting behaviors)

## Environmental Factors
* Weather conditions (wind patterns, temperature effects, storm avoidance)
* Geography (coastlines, mountain ranges, desert crossing, water bodies)
* Resource availability (feeding grounds, rest stops, water sources)

## Technical Considerations
* Coordinate systems (global coordinates, projection issues at poles)
* Temporal resolution (sampling frequency, movement data gaps)
* Data volume (tracked birds count, tracking duration, measurement frequency)

## Behavioral Patterns
* Social behavior (flock dynamics, breeding grounds gathering)
* Rest patterns (stop duration/frequency, preferred habitats)
* Feeding behavior (foraging areas, feeding duration, roost distance)

## Species-Specific Aspects
* Different behaviors (solitary vs social, predators vs prey)
* Physical capabilities (max flight distances, sustainable speeds, altitude limits)
* Habitat preferences (environment types, urban vs rural areas)

## Edge Cases and Anomalies
* Weather event pattern changes
* Predator avoidance behavior
* Human disturbance responses
* Injury/exhaustion effects

## Data Validation
* Movement speeds and distances
* Temporal patterns (day/night, seasonal)
* Geographic boundary checks
* Altitude constraints
