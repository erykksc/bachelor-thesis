% Context
Spatio-temporal databases are increasing in popularity due to increased
production of such data by numerous IoT devices.
As the need for such databases increases, developers try to reach for 
familiar  and open-source solutions.
MobilityDB, built on top of the spatial extension PostGIS, extends PostgreSQL's 
capabilities regarding spatio-temporal aspects.
Previous research has shown that the MobilityDB extension can be partially used
in conjunction with Citus, a PosgreSQL extension, which provides horizontal
scalability options.\footnote{

% Problem Statement
While specific queries runtimes of BerlinMOD benchmark have been 
evaluated on 4 and 28 node clusters\footref{footnote:mobilitydb},
horizontal and vertical scalability of the platform has not yet been fully
explored, especially write performance.
BerlinMOD queries are not designated for distributed MOD and different set of
queries is required to further assess its performance.
Moreover, testing with a wider range of cluster sizes is necessary to 
establish the scalability pattern.

% Solution Approach
In this thesis we aim to benchmark the vertical and horizontal scalability
using generated spatio-temporal data to measure metrics like request 
latency, query runtime, and read/write throughput under different data sizes.
% Aspired Implementation
Benchmarking data will be generated using a custom data generation tool
specifically developed for this study.
The tool will simulate the movement of birds, chosen due to their
seasonal migration patterns, localized movements within standard habitats,
varying flight heights and times. The testing setup can be seen on figure
\ref{fig:test_setup}.
%
We will compare the performance of MobilityDB combined with Citus on different
hardware configurations using Google Compute Engine service on Google Cloud
Platform.
Additionally, we will evaluate several scenarios, including vertically scaling 
a single node and scaling out by distributing MobilityDB across several 
Afterwards, we want to compare scalability trade-offs between those two
approaches.

% Analysis/ Evaluation
% TODO:
Query latencies and throughput measurements will be analyzed using confidence
intervals (95\% CI) to account for performance variability in distributed
systems. 
%
To visualize the distribution of latencies across different scaling
configurations, we will utilize Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function
(ECDF) plots, to reveal performance patterns and tail latencies.
%
In order to validate the statistical significance of performance differences
between vertical and horizontal scaling approaches, we will conduct paired
t-tests where appropriate.
%
Each benchmark configuration will be run multiple times to ensure statistical
reliability.
